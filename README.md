# Project Overview 
The purpose of this project was to build a dynamic flask web app. This web app contains three pages: index, about, and estimate_info. The estimate_info page calcuates the total cost of a cylinder tank based on the the buildings total area (the cost is estimated by labor cost of $15 and material cost of $25 per square foot). The estimate is displayed on the estimate_info page once values for height and radius are entered. 
## Languages used:
HTML, CSS, and Python
## Major takeaways 
#### Python functions
To complete this project I utilized local python functions to calcuate the cost estimation. By doing this I learned how to define my own variables to calcuate values. Additionally, I learned how to utilize POST and GET request to use inputed values from the form. 
#### Pytest 
This project was the first time I used pytest to evaluate the correctness of my application. Pytest helped me confirm and test my application during developement stages. 
## Future use 
In the future, I will take my new undertsanding of defining local variables based in user input information and apply it to other functions. When I need to calcualte a new result on a site I will have a foundational understanding from this project.
